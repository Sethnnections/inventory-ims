### üß© **1. Category Module (Next Step)**

**Why next:**
You already have the `Categorymodel.js` ready. Products will depend on categories ‚Äî so it‚Äôs essential to set this up before you move to the Product module.

**What to include:**

* CRUD operations for categories (`create`, `update`, `delete`, `list`)
* Validation for unique category names
* Integration into Activity Log (log when a category is created, edited, or deleted)
* Admin-only permissions for category management

**Endpoints example:**

```js
POST   /api/category/create
GET    /api/category/all
PUT    /api/category/update/:id
DELETE /api/category/delete/:id
```

---

### üì¶ **2. Product Module**

**Why next:**
`Inventory` and `Category` models both rely on `Product`. You‚Äôll need this before managing stock.

**Features:**

* CRUD for products (name, category, price, SKU, supplier, etc.)
* Product image upload
* Automatic linking to categories
* Logs via `ActivityLog`

**Endpoints:**

```js
POST   /api/product/create
GET    /api/product/all
PUT    /api/product/update/:id
DELETE /api/product/delete/:id
```

---

### üìä **3. Inventory Module**

**Why next:**
You already have `Inventorymodel.js`. Once products exist, you can link and track them in the inventory.

**Features:**

* Auto-status updates (`in-stock`, `low-stock`, `out-of-stock`)
* Quantity adjustments via stock in/out
* Integration with Product and Category
* Activity logging on quantity changes

**Endpoints:**

```js
POST   /api/inventory/add-stock
POST   /api/inventory/remove-stock
GET    /api/inventory/all
```

### üí∞ **4. Sales / POS Module**

**Why:**
After setting up users, products, and inventory, the POS (Point of Sale) comes next.

**Features:**

* Record sales transactions
* Deduct sold quantities from inventory
* Generate receipts/invoices
* Activity log entries for sales
* Integration with reports

---

### üì¶ **5. Purchases / Supplier Module**

**Why:**
Handle stock replenishment and procurement.

**Features:**

* Manage supplier info
* Record purchase orders
* Add received goods to inventory
* Activity logs for stock additions

---

### üìà **6. Reports Module**

**Why:**
Once you have transactions, inventory, and activity logs ‚Äî you can start summarizing data.

**Reports to include:**

* Sales summary
* Stock summary
* Low-stock alerts
* User activity (via `ActivityLog`)
* Revenue trends

---

### üßæ **7. Activity Log Integration**

You already have `ActivityLogmodel.js`.
You can now start **plugging it into every controller** (category, product, inventory, sales) to automatically log actions.

**Example integration:**

```js
const ActivityLog = require('../models/ActivityLogmodel');

await ActivityLog.create({
  action: "create",
  description: `New category '${req.body.name}' created`,
  userId: req.user.id,
  entity: "category",
  entityId: category._id,
  ipAddress: req.ip
});
```
